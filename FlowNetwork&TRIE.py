def maxThroughput(connections, maxIn, maxOut, origin, targets):
    """
        Function description:
                The algorithm of the whole maxThroughput is started by creating a networkgraph(actually residual graph) with an origin and a target.
                There is a list of data centres (vertices) and list of connections (edges) where each data centres has a capacity(min(MaxIn, MaxOut).
                Moreover, the sending of data between data centre is connected with a cable where it has information where the cable is connected to and from with a
                capacity flow as well. Thus, we can find the optimal flow from data centre to connection cable that won't exceed its capacity by taking a path finding the smallest
                remaining flow (capacity - flow) of connections cable and data centre. For example, source data center has 3000 max in and 2000 max out with a connection cable of 1500 capacity flow
                toward another tower centre (target) that has 1000 max in and 5000 max out. If we take the number 1000 and add the data centre with connection cable by 1000 will not exceed
                the capacity of the data centre and cable connected to. In the network graph a super target is created where all the data centre in the targets list will be connected to the super target.
                After adding all the necessary edge to the vertex then a network graph is fully created. By finding the min flow for each path and update the path with the min flow. In the end,
                we can find the max flow of the network graph.

        Approach description:
                The graph design approach is where each data centre represent a vertex and in the vertex itself has a list of edge show where the data centre can connect to with which data centre.
                Since the targets can be a list super target is always created no matter the target has one element in the list or not. After finish creating the vertex then edges will be added based
                on the connections list. Once all the edge(connections) are added, the edges that connected to the super target will get added as well. Once all finish executing, a network graph(residual graph)
                is created. Now using Breath first search (BFS) to go all the edges from source to target that create a path. With the path found, will then use to find min remaining flow (capacity - flow) across
                the path. Once the min remaining path is find update all the data centre and edges that is in the path. If the following edge(connections) is added then a reverse edge is created as well. Repeat the process by using
                BFS again to find a path until no augmented path can be found then the loop terminate and return a max flow based on the network graph created.

        Input:
            connections: a list connections of the direct communication channels between the data centres.
            maxIn: The maximum amount of incoming data that data centre i can process per second.
            maxOut: The sum of the throughputs across all incoming communication channels to data centre i.
            origin: The source data centre.
            targets: Data centres that are deemed appropriate locations for the backup data to be stored.
